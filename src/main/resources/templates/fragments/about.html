                        I've been fascinated with computers, technology, and science since I was a young child. 
                        I always enjoyed solving puzzles and being intellectually challenged.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        I got my first taste of programming before the age of 10, and in my teen years I built 
                        a gaming PC for myself and started teaching myself Java programming for Android development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my early 20s I began teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JS for web development while learning 
                        more Java for server-side applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From 2018 to 2020 I got to work in multiple professional tech positions including Computer
                        Technician for a school district, Software Development Apprentice, and Software Development Instructor.

                        My first project was mchistory.net (2016-2017), a website I built for the Mitchell County Historical 
                        Society. I used it as a practice project to gain a foundation of skills and knowledge. I packed years
                        worth of learning into a single year while also working multiple jobs. Looking back on it,
                        it's insane to think about how much I learned that year.

                    <p>
                        In 2018 I worked on a 3-month contract as a technician in the IT department of the Corsicana
                        Independent School District in Texas. I learned that their website cost them $25,000/year, which
                        seemed outrageous to me, so in my spare time I started building a clone of it that they could host
                        themselves. Although I never had time to finish it, I learned a lot of new skills while working on it.

                    <p>
                        In 2019 I went through the Techtonic software development apprenticeship program where I learned a 
                        whole new tech stack including Node.js, React, Redux, Firebase, and many other libraries, frameworks, 
                        and tools that I had never used before, as well as learning many new things about the skills and tools 
                        that I was already familiar with.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="teacher" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="teacher-tab">
                    <p>
                        Immediately after completing the apprenticeship, I was actually hired on as an instructor due to my
                        years of prior experience and my knowledge of Java, as Techtonic was actually quite interested in training
                        their developers on Java, C#, and more enterprise-oriented technologies rather than just JS. I had never
                        taught before, but for 2-3 months I did my best to throw together and teach an impromptu Java class to other
                        developers at the company. Despite single-handedly taking on an impossible task, I managed to exceed
                        expectations, and it actually resulted in a handful of junior Java developers entering Techtonic's developer
                        pool. I also learned quite a lot of new things myself while designing and teaching the class.

                    <p>
                        Although Techtonic is an amazing company and I love the people I worked with there, I felt that it wasn't the
                        best fit for me at this point in my life, and so I decided to resign and take some time to take care of myself
                        after enduring several years of severe stress and hardship. I'm currently self-employed driving for Lyft and
                        making good money, but still very interested in finding a software development job that I feel is a good fit for me.
